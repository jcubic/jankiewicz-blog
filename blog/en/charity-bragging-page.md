Do you donate to charities? I do. And in this post I decided to explain, why it's worth bragging about it.

{% card %}

Charities are non-profit, and the only money they have, come from donations. They often struggle to
encourage people to donate, not a lot of people are willing to do this. Some of the charities like
Wikipedia, Internet Archive, or Free Software Foundation do marketing campaigns to encourage people
to donate. Others do other things to encourage donors. Some Open Source Software encourage donations
as part of their interface, like GIMP or Inkscape.

Imagine what would happen if more people brag about donations to charities, and encourage others to
donate too. Imagine an influencer that have 1 million of followers. What would happen if he or she
shared that he or she donated to a cause he cares about and influence only 1% of those followers to
do the same. Imagine if that 1% of followers actually donate, and it could be at least 1 dollar It
will be 10,000 dollars for the charity. This is not a small amount of money. And this it's just
worse case scenario of 1% and $1, it can be much more.

That's why I decided to write this article, and encourage people to write their charity bragging
page, where they list charities they donate to, and explanation why they donate, with a link to
donate page.

This article is **my Charity bragging page**, and here are charities I donate to. The list may grow
in the future, I will try to keep the list up to date. Note that some of them are Open Source
projects, they are not exactly charities, but Open Source projects also operate on donations.

## Internet Archive

I'm a Wikipedia editor, and I can't image editing Wikipedia without Internet Archive. I mostly use
Wayback Machine to check how a website looked like in the past. I sometimes lent a book from its
digital library, also as a source for Wikipedia. If you want to read about how they operate, you can
check this [Twitter/X Thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1204428311553642496.html).

## Inkscape

I use Inkscape all the time. It's a graphic program which allows you to create vector images as SVG
files. SVG is the standard vector format on the Web. I use this tool since I started creating
artworks for [Open Clipart](https://openclipart.org/artist/kuba). I also use it for my graphic and
web design projects. I'm not a professional designer but can't imagine the world without Inkscape.

## Let's Encrypt

This charity singlehandlly make it possible for the most of the web to move to
[HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS). Making the world more secure place by issue free [SSL
certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security).  I donated multiple times,
the last time I was given a gift in exchange for donation:

All my websites are secured thanks to Let's Encrypt. Even that I don't need to manage the certificate
myself anymore. It's done by my hosting provider.

## Polish Wikipedia

I mostly donate via 1.5% of tax. In Poland, we can donate 1.5% of our tax to charity
organizations. I always donate to Wikipedia.  But I also support Polish Wikipedia as a volunteer,
I'm Polish Wikipedia editor and I take part in their conference "WZLOT". Beside editing, I'm also a
mentor for newcomers, and a Wiki Trainer.

## Web Mode

Web Mode is my goto extension when editing files in GNU Emacs.

## Free Software Foundation

Without FSF and GNU project there would be no Linux and no Open Source.  If you want to read about
the story of a person that started it all you can read a book: [Free as in
Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_as_in_Freedom).  I donated few times, but now mostly
[donate annually as a Member](https://my.fsf.org/join), you have [a few
perks](https://www.fsf.org/associate/benefits) if you join. I especially like access to
[Jitsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitsi) instance (a video conferencing app).

## 4ocean

I also support 4ocean that clean the ocean from plastic. It's not exactly donation, but you can buy
stuff from their shop and support their cause. I got a few things from them. I even got members of my
family a gift for Chrismas that I purchased from 4ocean.

## ImTranslator

The imTranslator is another Open Source project that I donated to. It's a Chrome Extension (that I
use with Brave) to translate selected text. I mostly use it for single words that I don't know. I
also you it to translate a sentence I wrote to see if I didn't make any silly mistakes.

If you use any of those Open Source projects and care about their cause, I encourage you to donate.
And also to create your own Charity Bragging Page, with your own list, that may encourage others.
