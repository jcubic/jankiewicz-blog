I'm a moderator in two communities on Twitter:

* [Software Engineering](https://x.com/i/communities/1699807431709041070)
* [Web Developers](https://x.com/i/communities/1488952693443997701)

A frequent question people ask is about advice or tips for new developers. I stopped answering those
questions, as they are a bit low-effort anyway. So I decided to write an article with my tips, and I
will share a link when someone asks this question.

## [Playground Project](#playground-project)

Learn the basics and do what I call a playground project. Test everything you learn, and every time
you have an idea, "I wonder if this will work...", you should just test it. If the programming
language is flexible, like JavaScript is, you can often combine syntax, like with Lego bricks.

## [Learn by Practice](#learn-by-practice)

If you want to learn anything, you need to practice. If you don't practice, you don't actually
learn. You only suffer from the illusion of knowing. The best way to practice is by creating a
project. You can start with small projects and, after finishing, you can tackle a bigger one. If you
want an idea for a project, check this repository with a list of ideas:

## [Learn by Teaching](#learn-by-teaching)

Teaching can take many forms; you don't need to stand in front of a class to teach. You can write a
blog post or share what you learn on social media. Before you write something, remember to do your
research; you need to learn the thing you want to write about well. You need to understand it in
order to teach others. That's why teaching is so powerful, because it forces you to learn something
deeply.

To start a blog, you can pick one of:
* [Medium](https://medium.com/).
* [DEV.to](https://dev.to/).
* [HashNode](https://hashnode.com/)
* [Substack](https://substack.com/)

## [Motivation](#motivation)

I personally never had a problem with motivation, because programming is my passion. I really love
doing this and don't need an extra push in this direction.

But if you have a problem with motivation yourself, I suggest:

### [Feeding Your Motivation](#feeding-your-motivation)

Remember why you're doing this. If you have a goal, keep that goal in mind when you feel like
quitting.

### [Connect With Others](#connect-with-others)

If you learn with other people, you can motivate each other to keep learning.

You can start the [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) and share what you
learn on social media.

### [Breaking Down Your Goals](#breaking-down-your-goals)

If you have a big goal, like learning programming, that may take a year or more, you should break
down your goals into smaller steps, like:

* Learning the basics of HTML
* Learning the basics of CSS
* Learning more advanced CSS

When you use your learning materials, they can have chapters or modules. They can be your smaller
steps.

### [Reward Yourself](#reward-yourself)

If you reach a milestone (or a smaller step toward your goal), or finish your daily learning task,
give yourself a reward. It can be anything, like:

* Watching an episode of your favorite TV series or listening to a podcast.
* Watching YouTube or TikTok if you prefer.
* Getting something sweet or a snack.
* Playing a bit of an online game.
* Taking a walk.
* Eating something sweet or a snack.

## [Conclusion](#conclusion)

Learning to code is a journey, and it’s not always easy, but it’s worth it. Start small with
playground projects, practice every day, share what you learn, and keep your motivation alive with
small rewards. Don’t give up when things get tough – break your goals into smaller steps and
celebrate every win. You’re not just learning to code; you’re building a skill that can open so many
doors. Keep going, and enjoy the process!
