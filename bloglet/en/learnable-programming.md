Longer essay by [Bret Victor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Victor) about computer systems
designed for learning programming. And why [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) live coding
is not one of those systems. It has a lot of examples how such system should look like, it even shows
how you could improve [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) live coding based system to make it easier to learn
programming. It's also worth reading if you teach programming.
